# beatstars_trackbot
A standardized python bot to maximize tracks plays on beatstars

# How to use
1- Install python
2- Run Installer.exe
3- Have your remote server IP address and password
4- Run server_setup.exe (This will copy all needed files to your brand new server, and will get everything ready for the bot)
5- Run Track Bot.exe and enter:
  * Server details: IP and password
  * Your profile URL on beatstars
  * Min duration to play each track
  * Max duration to play each track
  * Number of repeats: how many time do you want the bot to play each track
  * Use proxy or not (to change IPs)
  * If proxy used, after how many repeats you want the bot to change IP address?
  * How many instances of the bot you need to run in parallel? (This depends on server specs)
